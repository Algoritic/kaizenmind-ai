# Monorepo Plan for Testing Suite (KaizenMind AI)

## Vision

To build a suite of AI-powered tools for security testing, code review, and development lifecycle automation, all housed within a single, cohesive monorepo.

## Monorepo Structure

- **`/products`**: This directory will contain independent applications or services. Each subdirectory within `products` represents a distinct product with its own codebase, dependencies, and deployment strategy.
  - `ai-agent-unit-test-and-review`: The initial product, focusing on AI-driven unit test generation and code review.
  - *Future Products*: This could include tools for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing automation, security policy enforcement, etc.

- **`/frameworks`**: This directory is for shared libraries, common utilities, or foundational frameworks that can be consumed by multiple products. This promotes code reuse and consistency.

- **`/docs`**: Project-wide documentation, architectural decisions, and high-level plans.

- **`/dev`**: Contains development-specific tools, scripts, or temporary files that are not part of the main product builds.

## Product Development Workflow

1.  **New Product Incubation**: New product ideas will start as a subdirectory within `/products`.
2.  **Shared Components**: Identify common functionalities that can be extracted into `/frameworks` to avoid duplication.
3.  **Documentation**: Each product should have its own `README.md` and potentially a `docs/` subdirectory for product-specific documentation. Overall monorepo guidelines and architectural decisions will reside in the root `/docs`.

## Future Product Ideas (Brainstorming)

- **AI-powered Vulnerability Scanner**: Automatically identify common vulnerabilities in codebases.
- **Security Policy Enforcer**: An agent that ensures code adheres to defined security policies and best practices.
- **Automated Penetration Testing Agent**: An AI that can simulate attacks and report findings.
- **Threat Modeling Assistant**: Helps in identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the design phase.

## Contribution Guidelines

(To be detailed later, but will include aspects like consistent coding standards, testing requirements, and pull request processes.)

## Getting Started with a Product

Navigate to the specific product directory within `/products` and refer to its `README.md` for setup and usage instructions.
